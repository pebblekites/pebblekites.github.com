Valentine's Day is around the corner and it is just the  perfect day to show  your loved one that they are always thought about and cared for with love. And when the gifts you shower them with are handmade , it makes the occasion all the more special. 

This occasion is special for one of my friends in more than one way : it is Valentine's Day of course and she is getting engaged too. What better a  day to take vows which will last for a lifetime.

For this special day, I made her a heart-shaped easel card which she wanted to give to her fiancé. Her requirements were minimal – something heart shaped and simple, since this was her first gift for him. And this is what struck me.

I made this easel card for her with handmade paper and a red satin ribbon. I decorated the base of the card with cream coloured pearls and a simple sentiment which reads – You and Me.

The face of the card is decorated with satin ribbon plait and an embellishment with the silhouette of a guy proposing to a girl.  . My  husband then added a golden outline to make it stand out further.

I pasted the embellishment using double-sided stickers to give it some dimension. It is stuck on  handmade paper which is made even more delicate using doilies. To make the gift more personal, I made space to keep a message mat which is also heart shaped.

My husband who is my partner in everything I make and do made this assignment even more charismatic by making a box of his own! We then decorated it with ribbon bows to make it look prettier.
