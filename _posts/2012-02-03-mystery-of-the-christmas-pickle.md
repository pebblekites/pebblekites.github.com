It’s a strange juxtaposition: an ornament in the shape of a pickle hanging in your festively
decorated Christmas tree. The Christmas pickle is a beloved holiday tradition for some,
but one with very murky origins.

Though the details can vary, the basic premise is this: the Christmas tree is decorated and,
while the children sleep on Christmas Eve, a parent hangs a pickle ornament somewhere within
the branches of the tree. Because the green pickle is hidden amongst the green boughs,
it is difficult to see, and the first to find the special ornament on Christmas morning
would get an extra present, or be blessed with good luck all year.

This tradition is often said to have origins in 19th-century Germany. Though there is a long
history of blown-glass ornaments made there, a quick survey of my German friends found that
none had ever heard of a Weinachtsgurke.

Another story about the Christmas pickle is set during the American Civil War in the notorious
Andersonville prison, where a starving soldier begged for a pickle to sustain him. One of his
captors miraculously procured the desired gherkin and when the war ended, the man hung a pickle
ornament from his tree to commemorate his good fortune.

Regardless of its origins, the tradition of the Christmas pickle adds a layer of fun to the day’s
festivities. For many, no tree is complete without this tart treat!
