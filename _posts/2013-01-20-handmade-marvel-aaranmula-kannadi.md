In the lush green state of Kerala, by the waters of the river Pamba, there is a small village called Aranmula. Here was born a handcrafted marvel known as the Aranmula Kannadi. “Kannadi”, in the local language Malayalam means “mirror”. What is so special about the Aranmula mirror?

When I first heard about it, I was pleasantly surprised. The Aranmula Kannadi is a metal mirror. It looks and works just as beautifully as a glass mirror, but it is made of an alloy of copper and tin whose exact combination ratio is a zealously guarded secret, known only to a handful of craftsmen or “Asharis” in the village of Aranmula.

The history of this mirror is interwoven in legends and myths. Here is one such  legend. Many years ago, the Raja of Aranmula brought in a group of craftsmen from Tamil Nadu to construct bronze idols of Lord Parthasarathy. After the construction, these craftsmen continued their stay here under the patronage of the king. However, very soon, they began to lead a life of overindulgence and debauchery, annoying and inconveniencing the people around them. Greatly angered at their behaviour, the king threatened to evict them from the country. This put the craftsmen in a desperate fix as they, having long lost their roots in Tamil Nadu, had nowhere to go. They turned to none other than Lord Parthasarathy in devout prayer. It is believed that Lord Parthasarathy, almost as though in answer to their prayers, appeared in the dream of a widow, Parvathy Ammal, revealing the secret ratio of an unusual reflecting metal. Very soon, the craftsmen got to work on this unique combination and presented a beautiful, reflecting, metal crown to the king. The king was extremely pleased and ordered them to construct a mirror made of the same metal to place beside the idol of Lord Parthasarathy. So was born, the unique metal mirror of Aranmula, the Aranmula Kannadi.

To this day, the ratio of the metals that goes into the making of the mirror is a keenly guarded secret. What is even more amazing is the fact that this metallic marvel, a high-end product, is made using indigenous materials and methods. The mirror-making is a complex process that spans over several days. A crucible-cum-mould made of clay is used for the casting process. The metal pieces of the alloy are placed in the crucible and heated in a furnace. On heating, the molten metal flows down from the crucible into the circular clay mould. After cooling at a specific temperature, the clay mould  is then broken to reveal the raw form of the Aranmula kannadi. This still looks like metal which is then polished over several days until it is miraculously transformed into a perfect reflecting mirror - the Aranmula Kannadi.

This mirror is indeed a marvel. It reminds you of the vast amount of indigenous knowledge in the heart of our country, in its villages, in its people. It fills me with a respect for my country, its culture, its rich tradition in arts and crafts and creates in me a certain resolve to do what is in my power to keep our tradition going.
