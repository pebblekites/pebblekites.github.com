Ask any expatriate Indian to name the season that makes them homesick the most, and eight out of ten people would say: Autumn. Born in Kolkata, and a Bangalorean by choice, possibly the most I miss about my hometown are the six distinguishable seasons. Other than the usual five one finds in India, Bengal has a noticeable pre-winter season, aptly named Hemanta. And as soon as I feel a nip in the air, I feel like packing my bags and heading home. Like all across India, the festive season of autumn (and pre-winter) plays an important role in the rich culture of Bengal. The lush green region becomes resplendent with the “sweet songs of autumn”: cottony clouds, the brown and orange leaves, the white and orange siuli flowers, the ‘kashphul’, the white kolams or alpanas. And all these vignettes of a festive autumn find their reflection in the motifs of the Bengal tant saris.

Handcrafted designs on cards handed down through generations are used in the looms to craft out beautiful borders and pallus or aanchals. These elegant hand-woven motifs in contrast-coloured threads and light zaris are perfect for parties and special occasions. On the other hand, the lightweight and the soft paper tissue-like feel of the saris are comfortable for daily wear at work.

As the Bengal tant comes in different shades, ranging from pastels like milk white to sky blue, and dark earthy shades like bottle green and slate gray, they are also ideal gifts for women you love and admire, your mom and aunts or fashionable friends. Its comfort and elegance suit all ages.
