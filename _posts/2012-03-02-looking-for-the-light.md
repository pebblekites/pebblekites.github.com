title: Looking for the light
category: DIY
summary:  Headed home in the late afternoon, the long winter shadows are fading to black. Surrounded by chilly darkness, I think of the times before electricity and central heat, when the impending return of light and sun and warmer days was celebrated with feasts and dancing.

Spring brings in so many things:

- Color all around
- The chirpiness of the birds
- Spring break!
