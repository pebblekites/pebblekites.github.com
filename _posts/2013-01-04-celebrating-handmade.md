summary:  Handmade. Made of love. The  rich, moist chocolate cake that mom baked for your birthday. The pink, woollen sock you knit for your little one. The first handmade card your toddler gave you for Christmas. Everywhere, handmade speaks but the same language – love.

Handmade. Made of love. The  rich, moist chocolate cake that mom baked for your birthday. The pink, woollen sock you knit for your little one. The first handmade card your toddler gave you for Christmas. Everywhere, handmade speaks but the same language – love.

Here in this blog, we celebrate the real beauty of handmade, the true labour of love. Let this New Year be one of love. A love that transforms pebbles into diamonds with its magical touch. A love that fills your heart with warmth and makes you hold on to that handmade wonder that you will cherish forever.

Join us at PebbleKites. Together, let us celebrate handmade; let us celebrate love.
