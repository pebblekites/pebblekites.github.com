title: "My New Year Resolution and a \"Handmade\" Adventure"
category: DIY Projects
summary:  As always, I had a new set of resolutions for 2013 also. The New Year certainly brings out our best intentions, but most of the times, these resolutions don’t make it beyond the first couple of days. This year I targeted myself to what seemed a doable resolution – "go handmade".

As always, I had a new set of resolutions for 2013 also. The New Year certainly brings out our best intentions, but most of the times, these resolutions don’t make it beyond the first couple of days. This year I targeted myself to what seemed a doable resolution – "go handmade". 

I was particularly inspired by a beautiful hand-made gift that one of my colleagues got from his Secret Santa last Christmas. And as I was about to discard my 2012 desktop calendar, an idea struck me. How about turning this into a double-sided photo-frame? Trying to make my own handmade photo-frame was quite an adventure. So here it is. 

##Materials you need

1. A desktop calendar
2. White Glue
3. Craft Knife
4. 2 Pattern Papers/Chart paper
5. A Satin Ribbon
6. Pen/Pencil
7. OHP (Transparent Paper)
8. Beads, mirrors, handmade flowers or any decorative  item of your choice.

##Steps

1\. On each pattern paper, mark the outline of the photo of your choice. You can turn the paper upside down and draw the outline, like I have done here. Using a craft knife, cut through the outline and remove the rectangular block.

When you are done, this is what you will get.  It will be a good idea to cut a
10cmx8cm from the OHP (transparent paper) and stick it over the cut area. This will protect your photo from getting ruined. Unfortunately, I didn’t have it with me and I haven’t used it for this photo frame.

**Tip:** Instead of going for the rectangular cut inside you can try square, circular, elliptical or even some irregular patterns.

2\. Apply glue on the three sides of paper and stick it to your desktop calendar. Do not apply glue to the top side of the paper as this is where you will slide your photo in.

*You may have noticed a small square cut towards the right side of my calendar. Well, initially, I had this idea to slide my photo in from the right side of the calendar. I thought I could use this small hole to smoothly slide in or take out my photo like we usually do on professional photo frames. But, unfortunately, in my excitement to complete my first handmade craft, I applied glue on all sides of the calendar except the top. So, I decided to slide in my photo from the top and I couldn’t really make use of this square cut. Well, there is always next time :)*

3\. Now, your basic photo frame is ready. The next step is to decorate it.  I put in some sequins and handmade flowers on mine. You can use any decorative item of your choice such as beads, mirrors and flowers to beautify your calendar. Try to decorate both sides of the photo frame differently. Say for one side, you can use some flowers. For the other side, you can go for beads and mirrors.  Finally, thread in a thin, satin ribbon through the holes of the string on top of the calendar.

My ribbon was a little thicker than what could go in between the springs. So squeezing it in took me a long, long time.

What I learned from this step is that it is always better to try and put something that can easily go through the holes of the binder. Or, you can also try removing the string. That will make your work a lot easier.

4\. The last step is to slide your photo in though the top of your calendar and your handmade photo frame is ready for display.

My first attempt at handmade has been an adventure. I'm like a kid in a candy store.. so many new things to see; so many flavours to try.. I will be attempting more such "stunts" here at Pebble Kites. Follow along on this crazy ride. So what are you waiting for..? Bookmark the site and check it out often!
